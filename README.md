# SimpleNotepad
Some beginner windows programmers often bypass the windows API and delve straight into learning with helper classes such as MFC, I found myself struggling at some point to understand some simple WINAPI basic concepts and how MFC put them together, so I took a few days to study the windows API.

As a reuslt I decided to write a simple notepad project using pure with windows API with a C++ compiler. The code will also comiple with any C compiler as it does not leverage any C++ specific functionality.

I am thinking of doing some interesting things with this project but haven't thought too far ahead yet, however for those that want a quick reference for creating windows controls using WINAPI am sure you will find this a bit useful.

Hope this helps
